## About

I am a PhD student the Computer Science and Engineering program at the University of North Texas. I also completed a Master of Science in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience with a specialization in human-computer interaction (HCI) at the University Texas at Dallas in 2024.   

Prior to doctoral studies, I worked as a designer for about 12 years. My professional and academic experiences helped me recognize the significance of informing technological design decisions through research and testing.  

I hope to center my research on the ways in which technology is capable of improving human lives. The role of HCI in human spaceflight is especially fascinating to me, and I hope to continue exploring how technological design for the unique context of space can benefit human well-being more broadly.  

In addition to my design work and academic endeavors, I also enjoy travel, photography, and music production. I am a multi-instrumentalist with a strong interest in music technology, especially MIDI control and software synthesizers.  

### Research interests

Human-computer interaction, human factors in space exploration, human cognition, signal processing, sensors, microcontrollers, brain-computer interfaces, robotics, satellites, user interface design, user experience design, music technology
